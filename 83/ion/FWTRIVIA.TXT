How to Run
==========
Fantasy World Trivia requires version 1.6 of Ion to run. There is one program
file and four question files (volumes #1, #2, #3 and #4). Each question file
contains 384 questions.

TI-83 Users
-----------
Make sure Ion is installed on your calculator. Send FWTRIVIA.83P to your
calculator. Only one question file can fit on a TI-83, so send one of these:
  FWTQVOL1.83P
  FWTQVOL2.83P
  FWTQVOL3.83P
  FWTQVOL4.83P

TI-83+ Users
------------
Make sure Ion v1.6 is installed on your calculator. You may need to reset your
RAM to upgrade properly to v1.6 from an earlier version. Send FWTRIVIA.8XP to
either RAM or Flash ROM. Send to *Flash ROM* any or all of the question files:
  FWTQVOL1.8XP
  FWTQVOL2.8XP
  FWTQVOL3.8XP
  FWTQVOL4.8XP
You must have about 16KB of RAM free to run the game.


About
=====
Fantasy World Trivia is a quiz game for 1 to 9 players. There are more than
1500 multiple-choice questions and two different modes of play. The questions
are in six categories: Art & Literature, TV & Films, Geography, Music,
Science and Sport.

The questions were written in 1993, so you should answer them with this in
mind. However, this only affects a few questions.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, select a play mode (Cash Run or Pyramid) and press 2ND.
Once you are in the game, press one of the four arrow keys to answer a
question. The two play modes are simple to play: just follow the prompts
regarding whose turn is next. Note that if a player's turn is skipped, it
means that he has been eliminated and will not be given another turn in that
game. Both play modes are fair for each player, in that neither being the
first player or the last player hold any advantage. The following gives a
complete description of the two play modes.

Cash Run
--------
Five dollars are awarded for each correctly answered question. In a multi-
player game, the player with the most cash at the end wins. In the case of a
tie, further rounds are played among the tied players until the tie is broken.

Pyramid
-------
Each player starts at the base of their pyramid, which is shown on-screen.
They must answer questions until they give a correct answer, whereby they will
move to the next level of the pyramid and play will be passed to the next
player. At the base of the pyramid, players have 5 chances in which to answer
correctly; at the top, they have only one chance.

In a single-player game, the aim is to reach the top of the pyramid and answer
that question correctly.

In a multi-player game, players are eliminated at the end of each round based
on whether or not they gave a correct answer in that round. If no player gave
a correct answer, the round is replayed. Otherwise, all players who didn't
answer correctly are eliminated, and the others continue playing on the next
level of the pyramid (if they're not already at the top). The winner is the
last player remaining.
